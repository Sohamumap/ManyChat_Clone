# FlowDM: self-hosted Instagram DM automation

A self-hosted replacement for ManyChat's Instagram automations. It runs on one small server you
control (an AWS free-tier EC2 instance works), with no monthly subscription and no contact
limits.

## What it does

* **Comment → DM**: someone comments a keyword (e.g. `LINK`) on a post or reel and instantly
  gets a DM. Optionally the comment also gets a public reply, picked at random from your
  variants ("Sent you a DM! 📩"). You can match keywords by *contains*, *exact*, or *any
  comment*, limit it to specific posts, and DM each person only once.
* **Multi-step flows** built in a form-based editor:
  * messages with up to 3 buttons (go to another step, or open a link)
  * image cards
  * **follow-gate** ("follow me first, then tap to get the link"), using a real follow check
  * **collect email / phone / any answer**, with validation and retries; saved on the contact
  * delays between steps
  * tags for segmenting leads
  * personalization: `{first_name}`, `{username}`, `{email}`
* **DM keyword triggers**: reply when someone DMs a keyword.
* **Contacts**: everyone who interacted, with email/phone/tags, full conversation history, and
  CSV export.
* **Activity log**: every comment, the decision made, every flow run, raw webhooks and errors,
  so you can see exactly why something did or didn't fire.
* **Reliable by design**: webhooks are stored before processing, duplicates from Meta are
  ignored, rate limits and Instagram outages are retried with backoff, and access tokens refresh
  automatically before their 60-day expiry.

## How it works

```
Instagram ──webhook──▶ Caddy (HTTPS) ──▶ FastAPI ──stores event + job──▶ PostgreSQL
                          │                                                  │
   Browser ◀── React dashboard                       Worker ◀── claims jobs ─┘
                                                        │
                         Instagram Graph API ◀── private reply / DMs / public replies
```

| Part | Tech |
|---|---|
| API + webhooks | Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2 (async), Alembic |
| Background worker | Same codebase; durable job queue in Postgres (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), no Redis needed |
| Dashboard | React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 |
| HTTPS + static files | Caddy (free automatic Let's Encrypt certificates) |
| Deployment | Docker Compose; about 250 MB RAM total |

Instagram is accessed through the official **Instagram API with Instagram Login** using your
own Meta app.

## Getting started

1. **Deploy**: [docs/DEPLOY_AWS.md](docs/DEPLOY_AWS.md) (EC2 free tier + free DuckDNS domain + HTTPS).
2. **Connect Instagram**: [docs/META_SETUP.md](docs/META_SETUP.md) (Meta app, webhooks, testers,
   going live).
3. **Run locally / develop**: [docs/LOCAL_DEV.md](docs/LOCAL_DEV.md).

Quick local try-out (needs Docker):

```bash
./deploy/init-env.sh          # creates .env with random secrets, prints your login
docker compose up -d --build  # then open http://localhost
```

## Important: Meta App Review

While your Meta app is in *Development* mode, automations only fire for Instagram accounts
you've added as testers. To respond to **everyone**, the app must be switched to *Live*. Meta's
docs say comment webhooks need **Advanced Access**, which means **Business Verification + App
Review** (free, usually a few days). This is the one step ManyChat has done for you.
[META_SETUP.md §8](docs/META_SETUP.md#8-going-live-so-anyone-not-just-testers-triggers-your-automations)
walks through it. Everything else works with tester accounts in the meantime.

## Limits to know

These are Instagram platform rules, not FlowDM limitations:

* After the first DM to a commenter (a "private reply"), nothing more can be sent until they tap
  a button or reply, so start comment flows with a button. The templates already do this.
* Messages can only be sent within 24 hours of the person's last message or button tap.
* About 750 comment-triggered DMs per hour per account. Extra ones are queued, not lost.
